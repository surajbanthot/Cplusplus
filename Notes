uninitialized pointer
memory leak
dangling pointer

we can directly assign address value to the pointer 
int *p;
p=(int*)0x5638;

when ever declare a reference it has to be initialized

int x=10;

int &y=x;

now y is pointing to x with x having the address and the same address is set to y

Constructors:

1.default Constructors
2.Parametrised Constructors.
3.non parameterised constructors;
4.copy constructors;

copy constructors:-
Rectangle(Rectangle &rect)
{
    length=rect.length;
    breadth=rect.breadth;
}

Constructors in Inheritance 

int main()
{
    Derived d;
    default of Base is called first
    default of Derived is called later
}
